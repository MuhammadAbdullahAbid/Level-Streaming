# Level Loading System

This system provides a seamless level loading mechanism for incorporating sublevels into a scene after a player passes through a gate, teleporting them to the designated sublevel.

## Overview

The Level Loading System enhances gameplay by dynamically loading sublevels, allowing for an expansive and immersive gaming environment. This is particularly useful for scenarios where passing through a gate triggers the loading of additional content.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Level Loading

- Load sublevels into the scene as the player progresses through the game.

### Gate Trigger

- Activation is tied to passing through a designated gate.

### Player Teleportation

- Teleport the player to the newly loaded sublevel for a continuous gaming experience.
